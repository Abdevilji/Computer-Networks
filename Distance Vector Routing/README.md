Distance Vector Routing is a type of routing algorithm used in computer networks to determine the best path for data packets based on distance information.
Distance Vector Routing:

Each router maintains a routing table with distances to reach destinations.
Routers exchange routing updates with neighbors.
Updates contain entire routing tables.
Routers update tables based on received information.
Process repeats until convergence.
Examples include RIP and EIGRP.
Simple to implement but may suffer from slow convergence and routing loops.

This TCL script sets up a simple network scenario with nodes and links and simulates traffic using Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic sources.We will also see the different techniques  These techniques are called queue management algorithms. They are used in networking to control congestion and manage the flow of packets through routers and other network devices.
briefly:

1. **RED (Random Early Detection)**:
   - Drops packets before the queue fills up to manage congestion.
   - Not inherently fair among flows.

2. **SFQ (Stochastic Fairness Queueing)**:
   - Fairly allocates bandwidth among flows.
   - Serves packets from each flow in a round-robin manner.

3. **DropTail**:
   - Drops packets only when the queue is full.
   - Not fair; indiscriminate packet dropping.
